# Google Drive Automation

Drive Autimation Tool is a Google Apps Script add-on that automatically organizes files in a specified Google Drive folder. It extracts key information (Subject ID and Year) from Google Documents and moves files into corresponding subfolders based on this data, simplifying file management.

## Features

- **Automated Organization:** Extracts Subject ID and Year from document content to determine the correct destination folder.
- **Dynamic Folder Creation:** Automatically creates subfolders based on the extracted Subject ID and Year, or uses existing ones.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an interactive UI to input and validate the Google Drive Folder ID.
- **Error Handling:** Displays clear error messages for invalid Folder IDs and missing data.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account with access to Google Drive.
- Basic familiarity with Google Apps Script.
- Advanced Google Services enabled:
  - Drive API (v2)
